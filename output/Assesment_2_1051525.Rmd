## Penguins

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
source("scripts/import_clean.r")
source("scripts/import_image.r")
source("scripts/analysis.r")
source("scripts/badplot.r")
source("scripts/penguinplot1.r")

```


```{r badplot}
badplot
```


```{r}
#analysis
analysis1
analysis2
```

## Scale-location plot
The line is roughly horizontal line with a minor positive and no major deviations;  the points are also relatively evenly spread, suggesting acceptable homogeneity with no violation of equal variance. 

## Normal Q-Q plot
Points fall roughly along the straight diagonal line, with minor tailing off at either end, however, this does not violate the assumption that the residuals are normally distributed

```{r penguinplot1, message = FALSE}
#plot graph and save to as pdf in figures
penguinplot1
```
